**What Are Web Workers?** 

Traditionally, JavaScript is a single-threaded language. For example, 
if you have code trying to animate a DOM element, when you trying to change a variable have to wait for the animation to end.

Web workers are JavaScript files that execute in a separate thread with no direct access to the DOM.
Because that takes a lot of time to run, so you give them to the browser to execute in the background without affecting the JavaScript which is responsible for your web page.
